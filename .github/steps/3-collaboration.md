# Week 3: Collaborating with Git

In the third week of the course, you will practice:
- creating a new copy of the repository
- collaborating with others on the same repository

## 1. :book: Week 2 review
Review the content from the previous week reading more from Software Carpentry:
- [Remotes in Github](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github.html)
- [Resolving Conflicts](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict.html)

## 2 :book: :eyes: How to collaborate with Git?

> Questions:
> - What does it mean to fork a repository?
> - What are the ways of contributing to a repository?

## 3 :keyboard: :white_check_mark: Exercise 1: Contribute to a public repository
In the new branch that was created for this week `week3` you will find a new directory `week3` that will be used as a working directory for this week. 

Your exercise is to contribute to a public repository: https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/git-collaboration-practice

We will practice the entire workflow of contributing to a public repository:
- Fork the repository
- Clone the repository (from your fork to the `week3` in the Codespace)
- Create a new branch
- Add a new file or modify an existing file
- Commit the changes
- Push the changes to your fork
- Create a Pull Request to the original repository


> [!TIP]
> If you don't remember how to open Codespace, create a new file and add to the repository, you can review instruction from the previous week [here](./week1/Readme.md)

##

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update the repository in order to move to the next week/part of the course:
>  - After finishing all the exercises, create a Pull Request from the `week3` branch to the `main` branch
>  - Check the status of tests
>  - If all tests pass, merge the Pull Request, this should update a new `README.md` on the main page of the repository 
> (you can reload the page after 30-60s if you don't see the new content)
