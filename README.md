# Introduction to Version Control Systems

Welcome to the Introduction to Version Control Systems course. 
This course will be using GitHub and GitHub Skills templates, 
I strongly suggest completing two GitHub skills courses before starting the course:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- [Code with Codespace](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces) (the first 3 steps are enough for this course)

In this course you will:
- learn what is Version Control System (VCS) 
- practice using Git and GitHub
- practice creating new branches, Pull Requests and merging them
- practice working with other people on the same repository
- learn about VCS for big data files


### Course format
The entire course will have 4 parts or steps, each step will have multiple sections that will require reading short text or specific section from the external sources, watching a short video or practicing your knowledge in hands-on activities.
Every step should take no more than 1--2, hours and significantly less if you have prior experience.

## How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'Science-Reproducibility',
  template_name: 'version-control-systems',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'version-control-systems',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
